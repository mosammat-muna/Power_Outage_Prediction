<h1>Power Outage Prediction</h1>

<p>
This project analyzes the relationship between building energy efficiency (measured by ENERGY STAR scores) and power outages in NYC, with the hypothesis that buildings with lower ENERGY STAR scores experience more power outages. It uses two datasets: one on power outage complaints and another on building energy and water usage. The project involves preprocessing the data, applying various machine learning models (like linear regression, SVM, K-Means clustering, and Random Forest), and visualizing the results to understand how energy efficiency scores impact power outages.
